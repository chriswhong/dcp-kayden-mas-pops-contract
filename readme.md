# dcp-kayden-mas-pops-contract

A pdf copy, [obtained by FOIL request](https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/request/view/FOIL-2019-030-00269), of a 1999 contract by the NYC Department of City Planning regarding the creation of a database to document [NYC's Privately Owned Public Spaces](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/pops/pops-resources.page) (POPS).  

The database referenced here is no longer in use.  From to the DCP website:

"This initial POPS database served as the basis for the Departmentâ€™s current database, on which it maintains all POPS data, and which is critical to the Department meeting its obligations to report on the data and make it publicly available. The Department would like to give special thanks to Jerold Kayden and MAS for their financial support and ongoing contributions to the collection and dissemination of information about POPS, and for their advocacy work, overall."

## Why?

During my time at DCP, this agreement was cited in various meetings as a reason why POPS data could not be published as open data or included in web maps.  The data have since been published (see below).  I was never able to get a straight answer on what was included in the agreement that would prevent the city from openly sharing the data, so I FOILed the agreement.  

Section 1(b) of this agreement seems to clearly state DCP is allowed to treat this as any other dataset they maintain and publish:

"The Database and/or information contained therein shall also be available to members of the general public in the same manner as other databases or information maintained by DCP consistent with its obligations as a municipal agency."
